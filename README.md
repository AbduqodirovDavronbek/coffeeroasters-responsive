# coffeeroasters-responsive
I created this web site for Coursework 1 from Web Technology module. 
This website was created to fulfill Web Technology module’s requirements and does not represent an actual company or service. 
I created this website through https://www.figma.com/file/enwIJQIZA6oDBWuiOotH5D/coffeeroasters-subscription-site-(Copy)?t=kttjIB7Qsmvt45Sl-0 this design. 
i haven't finished it yet. I created only main page. However, I created two different web sites. I tried with all of my efforts. I used all of my front-end skills.
